I wanted to sincerely apologize for the difficulty I faced while working on the this coding task. 

Since I haven't yet learned React, I found myself struggling to come up with a proper solution. I'm truly sorry for this.

I'm currently working on learning React and doing my best to get up to speed as quickly as possible. 

If you have any recommended resources or guidance, I would be very grateful.

Once again, I apologize for my shortcomings, and I truly appreciate your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Kai LIAN
